Dependencies
============

Please see the requirements.txt file.

Install
=======

This package uses setuptools and Makefiles. 

I've made a workaround to deal with build dependencies of some requirements.
So there are two requirements files: requirements.txt and pip-requirements.txt.
The requirements.txt dependencies must be installed one by one, with::

    make install_deps

The following command will install everything with all dependencies::

    make install
    
If you already have the dependencies listed in requirements.txt installed, 
to install in your home directory, use::

    python setup.py install --user

To install for all users on Unix/Linux::

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

You can also install it in development mode with::

    make develop
